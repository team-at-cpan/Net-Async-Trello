    New features:

    - ->member method for retrieving information about a specific person
    - the ::Card->history method now returns proper ::CardAction instances, hopefully making it more useful
    - websockets have an undocumented `->websocket_events` stream so that activity (including ping response)
    can be monitored, e.g. watchdog reconnection behaviour
    - card comment and list/creation methods - thanks to Felipe for these
    - improved search, thanks Michael
